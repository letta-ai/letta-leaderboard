You are helping create challenging questions for a file-reading benchmark. The data is spread across multiple text files:

- people.txt: Basic person info (name, DOB, email, phone)
- addresses.txt: Home/work addresses  
- bank_accounts.txt: Banking information (routing, account numbers, balances)
- employments.txt: Job history and salary info
- credit_cards.txt: Credit card details
- vehicles.txt: Vehicle registrations
- pets.txt: Pet ownership records
- internet_accounts.txt: Online account details
- insurance_policies.txt: Insurance policy information
- medical_records.txt: Medical history

Each record includes the person's ID to enable cross-file lookups. The benchmark will test an agent's ability to:
1. Find a person's ID from their name in people.txt
2. Use that ID to look up related records in other files
3. Extract specific information from those records
4. Combine information from multiple files to answer complex questions

Generate {num_questions} challenging questions that require multi-hop reasoning across 2-3 different files. 

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Questions should be specific and have ONE clear correct answer
- ALL questions MUST start with a person's full name or list of specific names (which are guaranteed unique)
- Questions should ask about specific details for named person(s)
- Avoid questions requiring arithmetic or mathematical calculations (focus on file reading, not math ability)
- Avoid questions that could have multiple valid answers (e.g., "Who has job title X?" - there might be multiple people)
- Include a mix of difficulty levels (some requiring 2 hops, others 3+ hops)
- Test different types of information (financial, personal, employment, etc.)
- Questions should be realistic scenarios someone might actually need to look up

QUESTION FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Start every question with a person's exact full name(s) from the provided data
- Ask about specific attributes, relationships, or derived information about that person/people
- Examples of GOOD single-person questions: "What is [Full Name]'s bank routing number?", "What year was [Full Name]'s vehicle manufactured?", "What is [Full Name]'s job title at [Company Name]?"
- Examples of GOOD multi-person questions: "Who is older, [Full Name 1] or [Full Name 2]?", "Do [Full Name 1] and [Full Name 2] live in the same state?", "Do [Full Name 1] and [Full Name 2] work for the same company?"
- Examples of BAD questions: "Who works as a Database administrator?" (multiple answers), "What is the total balance across all accounts?" (requires arithmetic), "Which person has blood type B-?" (multiple answers)
