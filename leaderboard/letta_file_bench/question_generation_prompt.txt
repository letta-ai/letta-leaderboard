You are helping create challenging questions for a file-reading benchmark. The data is spread across multiple text files:

- people.txt: Basic person info (name, DOB, email, phone)
- addresses.txt: Home/work addresses  
- bank_accounts.txt: Banking information (routing, account numbers, balances)
- employments.txt: Job history and salary info
- credit_cards.txt: Credit card details
- vehicles.txt: Vehicle registrations
- pets.txt: Pet ownership records
- internet_accounts.txt: Online account details
- insurance_policies.txt: Insurance policy information
- medical_records.txt: Medical history

Each record includes the person's ID to enable cross-file lookups. The benchmark will test an agent's ability to:
1. Find a person's ID from their name in people.txt
2. Use that ID to look up related records in other files
3. Extract specific information from those records
4. Combine information from multiple files to answer complex questions

Generate {num_questions} challenging questions with a good mix of different types.

QUESTION TYPES (categorize each question):
- single_hop: One hop from people.txt to another file (e.g., "What is John Smith's bank routing number?")
- multi_hop: Reverse lookups starting from entity IDs (e.g., "How many pets does the owner of acct-0015 have?", "What is the job title of the person who owns card-0008?")
- comparison: Compare two or more people (e.g., "Who is older, John Smith or Jane Doe?", "Do John Smith and Jane Doe live in the same state?")

AVAILABLE ENTITY ID PREFIXES for multi_hop questions:
- acct-XXXX: Bank accounts (in bank_accounts.txt)
- card-XXXX: Credit cards (in credit_cards.txt)  
- veh-XXXX: Vehicles (in vehicles.txt)
- emp-XXXX: Employments (in employments.txt)
- ins-XXXX: Insurance policies (in insurance_policies.txt)
- addr-XXXX: Addresses (in addresses.txt)
- pet-XXXX: Pets (in pets.txt)
- net-XXXX: Internet accounts (in internet_accounts.txt)
- med-XXXX: Medical records (in medical_records.txt)

MULTI-HOP QUESTION EXAMPLES:
- "How many vehicles does the owner of acct-0015 have?"
- "What is the email address of the person who owns card-0008?"  
- "What state does the owner of veh-0023 live in?"
- "What is the salary of the person who has policy ins-0012?"

GENERATE A BALANCED MIX: Aim for roughly 40% comparison questions, 40% single_hop, 20% multi_hop.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Questions should be specific and have ONE clear correct answer
- MOST questions should start with a person's full name, BUT multi_hop questions can start with entity IDs
- For multi_hop questions, use the specific IDs from the provided data below
- Avoid questions requiring arithmetic or mathematical calculations (focus on file reading, not math ability)
- Avoid questions that could have multiple valid answers (e.g., "Who has job title X?" - there might be multiple people)
- Include a mix of difficulty levels (some requiring 2 hops, others 3+ hops)
- Test different types of information (financial, personal, employment, etc.)
- Questions should be realistic scenarios someone might actually need to look up

CRITICAL ANSWER REQUIREMENTS:
- Each question must have exactly ONE singular answer
- NO compound questions asking for multiple pieces of information
- NO questions with "and" requiring multiple answers
- Answers should be simple values: a number, a name, a date, a yes/no, etc.
- BAD: "What company does John Doe work for and what is his job title?" (two answers)
- GOOD: "What company does John Doe work for?" (one answer)
- GOOD: "What is John Doe's job title?" (one answer)

QUESTION FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Start every question with a person's exact full name(s) from the provided data
- Ask about ONE specific attribute only
- Examples of GOOD single-person questions: "What is [Full Name]'s bank routing number?", "What year was [Full Name]'s vehicle manufactured?", "What company does [Full Name] work for?"
- Examples of GOOD multi-person questions: "Who is older, [Full Name 1] or [Full Name 2]?", "Do [Full Name 1] and [Full Name 2] live in the same state?", "Do [Full Name 1] and [Full Name 2] work for the same company?"
- Examples of BAD questions: "Who works as a Database administrator?" (multiple answers), "What is the total balance across all accounts?" (requires arithmetic), "What company does John work for and what is his job title?" (compound question)
