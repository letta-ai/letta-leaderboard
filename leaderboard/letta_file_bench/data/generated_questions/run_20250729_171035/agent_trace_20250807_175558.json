Explore the data to find unique patterns\n2. Verify your question has exactly ONE answer\n3. Be creative - don't follow the same patterns as existing questions\n\nPERFORMANCE TIP: You can call execute_sql multiple times in parallel to explore different aspects simultaneously!\nFor example, you can check multiple tables or run several exploratory queries at once.\n\nWhen you have found a great question and verified it has a unique answer, call register_question ALONE (not in parallel).

Explore the data to find unique patterns\n2. Verify your question has exactly ONE answer\n3. Be creative - don't follow the same patterns as existing questions\n\nPERFORMANCE TIP: You can call execute_sql multiple times in parallel to explore different aspects simultaneously!\nFor example, you can check multiple tables or run several exploratory queries at once.\n\nWhen you have found a great question and verified it has a unique answer, call register_question ALONE (not in parallel).
