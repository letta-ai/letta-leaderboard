## QUALITY RUBRIC FOR GREP/OPEN_FILES BENCHMARK

### 1. COMPLEXITY BALANCE
- **Too Simple (REJECT)**: 
  - Single file lookups
  - Questions that can be answered with one grep command
  - Example: "What is the name of person with ID pers-0001?"

- **Too Complex (REJECT)**: 
  - Requires counting/aggregating across multiple files
  - Needs complex filtering that grep cannot handle (e.g., "exactly 4 accounts")
  - Requires joining data from 3+ different files
  - Example: "Among people who have both exactly 4 internet accounts and exactly 6 bank accounts..."

- **Just Right (ACCEPT)**: 
  - Requires searching 2-4 files (mostly 2-3)
  - Starts with a very specific, unique identifier
  - Clear path but needs careful execution
  - Example: "What type of pet does the person with bank account ending in 1234 own?"

### 2. GREP-ABILITY & COUNTING
- **Not Feasible (REJECT)**: 
  - Requires counting across hundreds of records
  - Needs to check every person in the database (1000+ people)
  - Complex aggregations across multiple large files
  - Example: "Among all 1000 people, who has exactly 4 internet accounts?"

- **Feasible (ACCEPT)**: 
  - Counting within a small group (5-15 people) after filtering
  - Requires 2-3 steps of narrowing down candidates
  - Clear starting point with specific identifier
  - Example: "Among the 5 employees at TechStartup Inc, who owns the most pets?"

### 3. CHALLENGING BUT FAIR PATTERNS
Accept questions that:
- Require 2-4 file lookups (occasionally up to 4, but mostly 2-3)
- Have a clear starting point with unique identifier
- Need careful execution but not excessive complexity
- Example: "How many credit cards does the owner of vehicle with plate 'XYZ-789' have?"

Reject questions that:
- Are trivial one-hop lookups
- Require impossible aggregations across many files
- Need complex mathematical operations
- Example: "What is the name of person with ID pers-0001?" (too easy)
- Example: "Total balance of all accounts owned by dog owners" (too hard)

### 5. EVALUATION APPROACH
For each question:
1. Read the question, SQL queries, and answer carefully
2. Assess against each rubric criterion
3. Consider if this tests meaningful file-searching abilities
4. Make a decision and provide clear reasoning
