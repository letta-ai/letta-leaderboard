You are helping create challenging questions for a file-reading benchmark. The data is spread across multiple text files:

- people.txt: Basic person info (name, DOB, email, phone)
- addresses.txt: Home/work addresses  
- bank_accounts.txt: Banking information (routing, account numbers, balances)
- employments.txt: Job history and salary info
- credit_cards.txt: Credit card details
- vehicles.txt: Vehicle registrations
- pets.txt: Pet ownership records
- internet_accounts.txt: Online account details
- insurance_policies.txt: Insurance policy information
- medical_records.txt: Medical history

Each record includes the person's ID to enable cross-file lookups. The benchmark will test an agent's ability to:
1. Find a person's ID from their name in people.txt
2. Use that ID to look up related records in other files
3. Extract specific information from those records

TASK: Generate ONE single-hop question about the person below.

SINGLE-HOP DEFINITION: One hop from people.txt to another file (e.g., "What is John Smith's bank routing number?")

REQUIREMENTS:
- Start with the person's exact full name: "{person_name}"
- Ask about ONE specific attribute from their records
- Question should require: people.txt → person_id → one other file → extract value
- Answer should be simple: a number, name, date, etc. (NO compound answers)
- NO questions requiring arithmetic or mathematical calculations
- Ensure the answer exists in the provided data

CRITICAL ANSWER REQUIREMENTS:
- Each question must have exactly ONE singular answer
- NO compound questions asking for multiple pieces of information
- NO questions with "and" requiring multiple answers
- Answers should be simple values: a number, a name, a date, etc.

PERSON DATA:
{person_data}
