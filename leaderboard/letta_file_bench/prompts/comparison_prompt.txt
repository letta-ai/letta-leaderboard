You are helping create challenging questions for a file-reading benchmark. The data is spread across multiple text files:

- people.txt: Basic person info (name, DOB, email, phone)
- addresses.txt: Home/work addresses  
- bank_accounts.txt: Banking information (routing, account numbers, balances)
- employments.txt: Job history and salary info
- credit_cards.txt: Credit card details
- vehicles.txt: Vehicle registrations
- pets.txt: Pet ownership records
- internet_accounts.txt: Online account details
- insurance_policies.txt: Insurance policy information
- medical_records.txt: Medical history

Each record includes the person's ID to enable cross-file lookups.

TASK: Generate ONE comparison question between the two people provided below.

COMPARISON DEFINITION: Compare two or more people (e.g., "Who is older, John Smith or Jane Doe?", "Do John Smith and Jane Doe live in the same state?")

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use both people's exact full names: "{person1_name}" and "{person2_name}"
- Ask for a comparison between the two people
- Answer should be simple: a name, yes/no, etc. (NO compound answers)
- NO questions requiring arithmetic or mathematical calculations
- Question should require looking up information about both people

COMPARISON QUESTION EXAMPLES:
- "Who is older, {person1_name} or {person2_name}?"
- "Do {person1_name} and {person2_name} live in the same state?"
- "Do {person1_name} and {person2_name} work for the same company?"
- "Who has more credit cards, {person1_name} or {person2_name}?"
- "Do {person1_name} and {person2_name} have the same blood type?"

EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR TIE SITUATIONS:
- If both people have 3 credit cards: Answer = "Tie" (NOT an arbitrary name)
- If both people have 2 vehicles: Answer = "Both have the same" (NOT picking one person)
- If both people have 1 pet: Answer = "Tie" (NOT choosing randomly)

CRITICAL ANSWER REQUIREMENTS:
- Each question must have exactly ONE singular answer
- NO compound questions asking for multiple pieces of information
- NO questions with "and" requiring multiple answers
- Answers should be simple values: a name, yes/no, etc.
- For "who has more" questions: If both people have the same amount, answer "Tie" or "Both have the same"
- NEVER pick an arbitrary winner when the comparison results in equal values
- In reasoning steps: When counts are equal, explicitly state "Both have the same number" and explain why the answer is "Tie"
